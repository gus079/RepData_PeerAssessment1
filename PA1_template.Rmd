This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


Loading packages
```{r, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(skimr)
theme_set(theme_bw())
```

# Loading dataset
```{r cars}
df_raw <- read.csv('activity.csv')
head(df_raw)
skim(df_raw)
```

# What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
```{r}
total_steps <- tapply(df_raw$steps, df_raw$date, FUN = sum, na.rm = TRUE)

ggplot(data.frame(total_steps), aes(total_steps)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1000, col = 'blue', fill = "lightblue") + 
  labs(x = 'Total steps per day') + 
  ggtitle('Total steps per day')

summary(total_steps)

```


# What is the average daily activity pattern?

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
avg <- aggregate(x = list(steps = df_raw$steps), by = list(interval = df_raw$interval), 
    FUN = mean, na.rm = TRUE)
ggplot(avg, aes(x = interval, y = steps)) + 
  geom_line(col = 'blue') + 
  xlab ("5-minute interval") + 
  ylab ("Average number of steps") + 
  ggtitle('Mean daily step pattern')


```

Which 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset, contains the maximum number of steps?
```{r}
avg[which.max(avg$steps), ]
```

# Imputing missing values
```{r}
colSums(is.na(df_raw))
```

Filling in all of the missing values in the dataset with the mean for that 5-minute interval
```{r}
impute.value <- function(steps, interval) {
    imputed <- NA
    if (!is.na(steps)) 
        imputed <- c(steps) else imputed <- (avg[avg$interval == interval, "steps"])
    return(imputed)
}
df_imputed <- df_raw
df_imputed$steps <- mapply(impute.value, df_imputed$steps, df_imputed$interval)

colSums(is.na(df_imputed))
head(df_imputed)
```

Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day and Calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day.
```{r}
total_steps_imp <- tapply(df_imputed$steps, df_imputed$date, FUN = sum)
ggplot(data.frame(total_steps_imp), aes(total_steps_imp)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1000, col = 'darkgrey', fill = "lightgreen") + 
  labs(x = 'Total steps per day') + 
  ggtitle('Total steps per day (imputed data)')
```

Report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day.
The mean imputation reduces the variance of the data.
```{r}
print(paste("The mean is: ", round(mean(total_steps_imp),2)))

print(paste("The median is: ", round(median(total_steps_imp),2)))
```


Do these values differ from the estimates from the first part of the assignment?
The mean imputation reduces the variance of the data.
```{r}
summary_compare <- data.frame(mean = c(mean(total_steps), mean(total_steps_imp)),
                              median = c(median(total_steps), median(total_steps_imp)))
rownames(summary_compare) <- c("Pre Imputation", "Post imputation")
summary_compare

```

```{r}
df_imp_ww <- df_imputed
df_imp_ww$date <- as.Date(df_imp_ww$date)
df_imp_ww$day <- ifelse(weekdays(df_imp_ww$date) %in% c("Saturday", "Sunday", "domingo", "sabado"), "weekend", "weekday")
df_imp_ww$day <- as.factor(df_imp_ww$day)
```

```{r}
act_weekday <- filter(df_imp_ww, df_imp_ww$day == "weekday")
act_weekend <- filter(df_imp_ww, df_imp_ww$day == "weekend")

act_weekday <- act_weekday %>%
        group_by(interval) %>%
        summarize(steps = mean(steps)) 
act_weekday$day <- "weekday"

act_weekend <- act_weekend %>%
        group_by(interval) %>%
        summarize(steps = mean(steps)) 
act_weekend$day <- "weekend"

wkdayWkend <- rbind(act_weekday, act_weekend)
wkdayWkend$day <- as.factor(wkdayWkend$day)

str(wkdayWkend)


g <- ggplot (wkdayWkend, aes (interval, steps, color = day))
g + geom_line() + 
        theme(axis.text = element_text(size = 12),axis.title = element_text(size = 14)) + 
        labs(y = "Number of Steps") + labs(x = "Interval") + 
        ggtitle("Average Number of Steps - Weekday vs. Weekend") + 
        theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) 
```

The graph shows differences in the step patterns throughout the average daily intervals. 
For weekdays there is a larger spikes in the morning that could imply commuters.
